Wheat TILLING Project - JBrowse
===============

#JBrowse configuration

Custom javascript code was added to the VCF track configurations for color-coding mutations and displaying Seed Stock availability. Our project also uses a fastloader plugin to display the VCF files which can be downloaded from the project's github page [here](https://github.com/cmdcolin/fastloader).
